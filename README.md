# Front-End Helper
Front-End Helper - helps you learn HTML, CSS, and JS or helps you find some new ideas.

## Project Mission
My Mission is to help people learn new features every day. This project will use template engine (Jade and Handlebars) to compile to HTML.

## Quick Start Install
Make sure you've installed Node.js - I recommend the latest Node v0.10.x release.

Several quick start options are available:


1. Download
  + [Download the latest release](https://github.com/nikolenkoanton92/front-end-helper/archive/master.zip).
  + Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/nikolenkoanton92/front-end-helper.git
3. Fire up a terminal
4. `npm install`
5. I use the default template, Jade. If you would like to use the Handlebars template, you should input in the command line `TEMPLATE='hbs' && node ./bin/www`
6. Start Front-End Helper:
  + `npm start`
  + `node ./bin/www`
